## Wins
- I built this whole comp by myself. Holy cow
- I didn't have near the struggles with fetch and post that I did in the previous project.

## Challenges
- I struggled with getting some of the tests to pass.
- Having to match ids between trips and destinations always took longer than I expected it to.

## Future Iterations
- Fix random NaN for money spent with some users
- Add Travel agent functionality
- Ability to create a new user
- Finish incorporating SCSS
